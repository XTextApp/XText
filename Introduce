XText is a safe and easy-to-use text encryption assistant. It is repackaged based on AES encryption technology, making it extremely difficult to crack ciphertext; making it impossible for AI and humans to recognize your text content.

[Function Highlights]
1. Real-time encryption: Each letter entered will be encrypted synchronously
2. No need to log in: anonymous use
3. Automatic ciphertext recognition: Not all ciphertext is XText
4. Client-to-client key encryption: Only you and the other party can decrypt
5. Custom key encryption: Only people with the same key can decrypt
6. Time Attribute: The cipher becomes active and expires at a specified time, preventing the message from being directly forwarded or screenshot forwarded.
