In a medium-sized company, the CEO, Mr. Li, and the financial manager, Ms. Zhang, took precautions against online fraud by preemptively adding each other's IDs on a secure encryption app. They established an end-to-end encrypted communication channel. This channel ensured that all messages exchanged between them could not be intercepted or altered by third parties, while also verifying the authenticity of the sender's identity through encryption.

One day, Ms. Zhang received an urgent message from Mr. Li, instructing her to immediately transfer a large sum of money to a specific account. The message came with seemingly reasonable explanations, emphasizing the urgency of the matter. Ms. Zhang's initial reaction was one of suspicion, as Mr. Li typically wouldn't send such important instructions via regular SMS or email and would normally use encrypted communication.

It was then that Ms. Zhang realized someone was impersonating Mr. Li, attempting to commit fraud by issuing forged directives.

Thanks to the protection of the encryption app, Ms. Zhang was able to quickly verify the true identity of the sender and avoid a significant financial loss for the company. This incident not only highlights the importance of end-to-end encryption in preventing fraud but also demonstrates the effectiveness of setting up encrypted channels in advance to ensure identity verification.
